# .NET 8 API Backend

This project is a powerful and scalable API built with **.NET 8** using a modern and clean architecture. The backend is designed to follow **Clean Code** and **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** principles. It leverages **MediatR** for handling requests in a decoupled manner, ensuring maintainability and testability. Below is an overview of the tech stack, architecture, and the practices followed to ensure a high-quality, maintainable, and scalable API.

## Tech Stack:
- **.NET 8**: The latest version of the .NET platform, optimized for performance, scalability, and modern development practices.
- **MediatR**: For handling commands and queries using the CQRS pattern in a decoupled and scalable manner.
- **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**: For database management and ORM, ensuring easy interaction with the database while adhering to **SOLID** principles.
- **FluentValidation**: Used for robust and consistent validation across commands and queries.
- **AutoMapper**: Simplifies object-to-object mapping, reducing repetitive code while maintaining separation of concerns.
- **SOLID Principles**: Ensures that the architecture is clean, extensible, and maintainable.

## Architecture Overview:
- **Clean Architecture**: The project strictly follows clean architecture principles, ensuring that domain logic remains pure and independent from external concerns like UI or databases.
- **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**: Commands and queries are separated for better scalability and maintainability, allowing for clearer structure and easier extension.
- **MediatR**: Used to dispatch both commands and queries, keeping the layers decoupled and testable.

## Key Features:
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Token) based authentication system for secure access to the API endpoints.
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control, ensuring that only authorized users can access specific resources.
- **Email Services**: Built-in email services to handle user notifications, password resets, and other automated emails.
- **FluentValidation**: Ensures that all incoming requests are validated according to the defined business rules, minimizing errors and enforcing consistency.
- **AutoMapper**: Automatically maps data transfer objects (DTOs) to domain models, ensuring separation of concerns and reducing code repetition.

## Testing:
The project contains a variety of tests to ensure the correctness and reliability of the API:
- **Unit Tests**: Ensure that individual components function as expected in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify that different modules work together as intended.
- **Functional Tests**: Simulate real-world scenarios to ensure that the API behaves correctly from an end-user perspective.

## Example Tests:
- **Unit Tests**: Testing individual services, repositories, and other isolated components.
- **Functional Tests**: Testing API controllers with mocked dependencies, verifying that the system behaves as expected under real-world scenarios.
- **Integration Tests**: Testing the full data flow through the system, including database interactions, using in-memory databases or full-fledged setups.

## Docker Integration:
The backend is fully containerized using **Docker** to ensure easy deployment and consistency across different environments. A simple Docker configuration is provided to run the entire application.

## Key Packages:
- **MediatR**: Decouples the sending of commands/queries from their handling, following CQRS principles.
- **Entity Framework Core**: For database management and ORM, ensuring that database interactions are efficient and easy to maintain.
- **FluentValidation**: Provides a fluent API for building validation rules for your domain models.
- **AutoMapper**: Simplifies the mapping of data transfer objects (DTOs) to domain models, making your code more maintainable.
- **JWT Bearer Authentication**: Provides a secure method of authenticating users and services, ensuring that your API is protected from unauthorized access.

## Conclusion:
This project demonstrates a modern, scalable, and maintainable approach to building APIs with **.NET 8**. By adhering to industry best practices like **Clean Architecture**, **CQRS**, and **SOLID** principles, this API is designed to be robust, scalable, and easy to extend. The use of **MediatR**, **FluentValidation**, and **AutoMapper** ensures a clean separation of concerns, while the tests and Docker integration make it easy to maintain and deploy in any environment.

This is a perfect example of a professional-grade API that can be deployed in production for handling complex business logic, authentication, and data management.
